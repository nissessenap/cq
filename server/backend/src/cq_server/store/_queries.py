"""Shared SQLAlchemy Core query helpers for portable cq server queries.

Centralises every SQL statement that is portable between SQLite and
PostgreSQL. Concrete ``Store`` implementations (``SqliteStore``,
``PostgresStore``) compose these helpers for the boring queries while
keeping dialect-specific code (PRAGMAs, advisory locks, vector search,
full-text search) inside their own classes.

The module is pure: no engine, no connection, no metadata. Statements are
either:

* Module-level :class:`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.TextClause` constants
  for static queries, with named ``:placeholder`` parameters.
* Small builder functions returning a ``TextClause`` for queries whose
  shape depends on caller arguments (variable IN-list or conditional
  WHERE).

Callers bind named parameters at execute time. Out of scope here:
PRAGMAs, ``pg_advisory_lock``, vector (sqlite-vec / pgvector), full-text
(FTS5 / ``tsvector``). Those live in their respective concrete stores.

``daily_counts`` is portable when the date cutoff is computed in Python
and passed in as a ``:cutoff`` ISO date string; the SQLite-specific
``date('now', '-N days')`` form has been removed here per RFC #275.

Load-bearing assumption — ``date(reviewed_at)`` / ``date(created_at)`` in
the daily-count helpers below: these run against ``TEXT`` columns through
Phase 2. SQLite's ``date()`` parses ISO strings natively. PostgreSQL has
no ``date(text)`` overload, but with the default ``DateStyle=ISO`` it
implicit-casts ISO-8601-with-offset strings to ``timestamptz`` before
applying the built-in ``date(timestamp)`` function. Operators running PG
under a non-default ``DateStyle`` may see this fail. Phase 3 (#317)
removes this dependency by migrating PG timestamps to
``TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE``; SQLite continues to store ISO strings.
After #317 the same SQL is portable through two distinct mechanisms.
