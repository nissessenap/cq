"""Run Alembic migrations at server startup.

Three cases the runner has to handle, all covered by
``run_migrations``:

* New database (no tables) — ``upgrade head`` creates everything via
  the baseline migration.
* Existing pre-Alembic database (``knowledge_units`` exists,
  ``alembic_version`` does not) — ``stamp`` at the baseline so Alembic
  records "the current schema is what the baseline migration would
  have produced", then ``upgrade head`` to apply any later migrations.
* Already-stamped database — ``upgrade head`` is a no-op when there
  are no pending migrations.

The baseline revision id is exported so tests and ops scripts can
reference it without parsing migration files.
