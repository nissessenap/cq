## Initial Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mozilla-ai/cq.git
cd cq
make setup
```

## Installing from Source

### Claude Code

```bash
make install-claude
```

To uninstall:

```bash
make uninstall-claude
```
If you configured remote sync, remove `CQ_ADDR` and `CQ_API_KEY` from `~/.claude/settings.json`, or remove the entire `env` block added for remote sync.

### OpenCode

```bash
make install-opencode
```

Or for a specific project:

```bash
make install-opencode PROJECT=/path/to/your/project
```

To uninstall:

```bash
make uninstall-opencode
# or for a specific project:
make uninstall-opencode PROJECT=/path/to/your/project
```
If you configured remote sync, remove the `environment` block from the cq entry in your OpenCode config.

### Cursor

```bash
make install-cursor
```

To uninstall:

```bash
make uninstall-cursor
# or for a specific project:
make uninstall-cursor PROJECT=/path/to/your/project
```

### Windsurf

Windsurf has no per-project MCP config, so only a global install is supported.

```bash
make install-windsurf
```

To uninstall:

```bash
make uninstall-windsurf
```

### Go SDK

```bash
go get github.com/mozilla-ai/cq/sdk/go
```

### Go CLI

See [`cli/README.md`](cli/README.md) for Homebrew, GitHub Releases, and from-source install instructions.

## Running Locally

The quickest way to run everything is with Docker Compose.

Export the required secret first:

```bash
export CQ_JWT_SECRET=dev-secret
```

Start all services (runs in the foreground):

```bash
make compose-up
```

In a separate terminal, create a user and load sample knowledge units:

```bash
make seed-all USER=demo PASS=demo123
```

The remote API is available at `http://localhost:3000`.

For isolated component testing outside Docker, use `make dev-api` (remote API) and `make dev-ui` (dashboard).

## Agent Configuration

To point your agent at a local API instance, set `CQ_ADDR`.

### Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json` under the `env` key:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CQ_ADDR": "http://localhost:3000"
  }
}
```

### OpenCode

Add to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` or your project-level config, in the MCP server's `environment` key (not `env`):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "cq": {
      "environment": {
        "CQ_ADDR": "http://localhost:3000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

cq works out of the box in local-only mode with no configuration. Set environment variables to customize the local store path or connect to a remote API.

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `CQ_LOCAL_DB_PATH` | No | `~/.local/share/cq/local.db` | Path to the local SQLite database (follows [XDG Base Directory spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir/latest/); respects `$XDG_DATA_HOME`) |
| `CQ_ADDR` | No | *(disabled)* | Remote API URL. Set to enable remote sync (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `CQ_API_KEY` | When remote configured | — | API key for remote API write operations (`propose`, `confirm`, `flag`) |

### Self-hosted server

Running the server (see `server/`) requires:

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `CQ_JWT_SECRET` | Yes | — | Secret used to sign JWTs issued by `/auth/login`. |
| `CQ_API_KEY_PEPPER` | Yes | — | Server-side pepper combined with each API key under HMAC-SHA256. |
| `CQ_DATABASE_URL` | No | — | SQLAlchemy URL for the backing database. Currently only `sqlite:///<path>` is supported; `postgresql+psycopg://...` is reserved for the upcoming PostgreSQL backend ([epic #257](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/cq/issues/257)) and rejected at startup. |
| `CQ_DB_PATH` | No | `/data/cq.db` | Shortcut for SQLite deployments — wrapped as `sqlite:///<path>` internally. Used when `CQ_DATABASE_URL` is unset. |
| `CQ_PORT` | No | `3000` | HTTP listen port. |

API keys are created per user from the web UI: log in, open **API Keys**, give the key a name, choose a TTL, and copy the plaintext token when it is shown. The token is displayed exactly once. Set it as `CQ_API_KEY` on each client (plugin, SDK, CLI) that should authenticate against this server.

The data-plane write routes (`/propose`, `/confirm`, `/flag`) require a valid API key. Reads (`/query`, `/stats`, `/health`) remain open.

## Docker Compose

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `make compose-up` | Build and start services |
| `make compose-down` | Stop services |
| `make compose-reset` | Stop services and wipe database |
| `make seed-users USER=demo PASS=demo123` | Create a user |
| `make seed-kus USER=demo PASS=demo123` | Load sample knowledge units |
| `make seed-all USER=demo PASS=demo123` | Create user and load sample KUs |

## Validation

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `make lint` | Format, lint, and type-check all components |
| `make test` | Type checks and tests across plugin server and server backend |

## Status

Exploratory — this is a `0.x.x` project. Expect breaking changes to the database format and SDK interfaces before v1. We'll provide migration scripts where possible so your knowledge units survive upgrades.

See [`docs/`](docs/) for the proposal and PoC design.

### Migrating from earlier releases

The local SQLite database format changed during the 0.x cycle (enum values, field names, ID format). If you have knowledge units from an earlier version, run the migration script to bring them up to date:

```bash
# Local SDK database (auto-detects path).
./server/scripts/migrate-v1.sh

# Explicit path.
./server/scripts/migrate-v1.sh ~/.local/share/cq/local.db

# Remote server running in a container.
docker compose exec cq-server bash /app/scripts/migrate-v1.sh
```

The script is idempotent — safe to run multiple times, on any 0.x database. It creates a backup before modifying anything. See the script header for full details.

## Windows

Windows doesn't ship `make`, so the Makefile targets aren't available. Use the PowerShell wrapper instead:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1 install --target cursor --global
.\scripts\install.ps1 install --target windsurf --global
.\scripts\install.ps1 install --target opencode --global
```

Or invoke the installer directly:

```powershell
cd scripts\install
uv run python -m cq_install install --target cursor --global
```

To uninstall, replace `install` with `uninstall`:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1 uninstall --target cursor --global
```

### Config paths

Config paths are home-directory-relative, same as POSIX (`Path.home()` resolves to `%USERPROFILE%` on Windows):

| Host | Path |
|------|------|
| Cursor | `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json` |
| Windsurf | `%USERPROFILE%\.codeium\windsurf\mcp_config.json` |
| OpenCode | `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\opencode.json` |
| Shared skills | `%USERPROFILE%\.agents\skills\cq\` |

### Python on PATH

The installer writes `python` (not `python3`) into the generated config on Windows. You need Python 3.11+ on PATH under that name for the MCP server to launch. The installer itself requires `uv`.

## Environment Variable Reference

### Installer and plugin bootstrap

These variables are used by the multi-host installer and plugin bootstrap runtime. Most users won't need to set any of them.

| Variable | Used by | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` | Claude plugin bootstrap | Provided by Claude; not normally set manually | Points bootstrap to the Claude-managed installed plugin root |
| `CQ_INSTALL_PLUGIN_ROOT` | Installer CLI | Auto-detected `plugins/cq` in repo | Dev/test override for resolving plugin source tree during installer runs |
| `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` | Installer (OpenCode host) | `~/.config/opencode` | Overrides OpenCode global config target directory for install/uninstall |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME` | Installer + plugin bootstrap | `~/.local/share` | Base data directory for shared cq runtime assets (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/cq/runtime`) |

#### Windows-only fallbacks

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `LOCALAPPDATA` | `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local` | Windows per-user fallback when `XDG_DATA_HOME` is unset |
| `APPDATA` | Used if `LOCALAPPDATA` unset | Secondary Windows fallback for shared runtime base directory |
